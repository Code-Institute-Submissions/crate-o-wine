Crate O' Wine is a monthly wine subscription that allows customers to receive a new assortment of wines every month to their doorstep.

It was designed and built with a mobile-first development strategy. This was possible by leveraging Bootstrap.

Website deployed using GitHub Pages - [See Live](https://kenwilde1.github.io/crate-o-wine/).

## User Experience (UX)

---

### Objective

The Objective of the UX process was to provide end-user (potential customers) with a clear and succint way to interact and retrieve information from within the website. Through this, we avoid overwhelming the end-user with too much information and give them the freedom to navigate the website as they please.

A Secondary Objective served to provide a short path to drive users towards purchasing the product. It was important to do this in as few clicks as possible in order to hold onto the end-user's attention.

### User Goals and Stories

As an End-User, the goal is to learn about the product so you can make an educated purchasing decision. As the Site Owner, in order to help the end-user achieve this goal, the website was designed to provide freedom of navigation with clear and succint data points. As the end-user becomes overwhelmed with buttons, paragraphs and other components, the chance of leaving the page increases.

Every component of the website was built with a User Story in mind. This included NavBar, Carousels, Information Containers, Footers etc. No component was built without providing a User Story as a form of justification.

You can view the User Stories [here]('./assets/docs/User-Stories.pdf'). For every user story, a visual card was created. It had a 'title' which served as the reason to build out a selected feature. Below that, you can see that _why_ the user would want this.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created pre-emptively in order to provide a schematic for how the website would look on every page and device. The Wireframes covered Desktop, Tablet and Mobile for responsive design. They are an original mock-up and some components may vary on the live preview of the website.

You can view the Wireframes [here]('./assets/docs/Wireframes-Desktop-Tablet-Mobile.pdf').

Here is a preview of the Home page on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile:

## Site Components

---

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

  - The project uses **HTML5** to structure the components of the pages, this includes the Nav, Main Content and Footer.

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

  - The project uses **CSS3** to add styling to certain components of the page.

- [Bootstrap 4](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  - The project uses **Bootstrap 4** to tell the browser how the page layout should look using containers, rows and columns. Each component on the page uses Bootstrap and/or Flexbox to provide layout.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
